# AtliQ-Mart-Supply-Chain-Analysis
In this project, I performed data analysis and designed a Power BI dashboard. The analysis focused on various key metrics and trends, and the dashboard presents these insights in a clear and visual format.

# Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

Tasks:  
Peter Pandey is the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined AtliQ Mart recently. He has been briefed about the the task in the stakeholder business review meeting. Now imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and play the role of the new data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task:

Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in comic form.
Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

# Data Modeling in Reporting  
Data modeling is the foundation of any report and plays a vital role in its success. All visuals and insights are built upon the data model. A well-structured data model ensures optimal report performance, while poor data modeling can negatively impact overall performance.  

## Data Modeling Approach  
In this project, we followed the **Star Schema** method for data modeling. This approach:  
- Simplifies the data structure.  
- Enhances query performance.  
- Makes it easier to build visuals and generate insights.
  
By adopting the Star Schema, we ensured clarity, efficiency, and scalability for the report.

## Conclusion

This project shows my ability to analyze data and create clear visual reports using Power BI. I have learned how to work with data and present it in a way that is easy to understand. 

## Next Steps

- Keep improving my data analysis skills by working with more complex datasets.
- Learn more advanced Power BI features to create better reports.

Thank you for reviewing my project!
